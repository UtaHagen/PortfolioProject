# S&P 500 Stock Picker

## Project Description
This project is designed to analyze stocks from the S&P 500 index and select the best performing ones based on specific criteria. It uses Python and various data analysis libraries to process financial data and make informed stock selections.

## Features
- Retrieves up-to-date stock data from the S&P 500 index
- Analyzes stock performance using key financial metrics
- Identifies and ranks top-performing stocks
- Generates a list of recommended stocks for potential investment

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- yfinance (for retrieving stock data)
- pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
- matplotlib (for data visualization, if applicable)

## Project Structure
- `Data`: Directory for storing input data files.
- `notebooks`: Directory for storing stock picking notebooks.
- `Results`: Directory for storing output data files.
- `price pull v1.py`: Python script for retrieving stock data and making price predictions.
- `run-notebooks.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for executing the project's notebooks and processing the results.


## How to Use
1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/top 10 pick code.ipynb` to execute the stock analysis and selection process.
5. Alternatively, use `run-notebooks.ipynb` to execute the analysis notebook programmatically.

## Output
The notebook will generate a list of top-performing stocks from the S&P 500 based on the implemented analysis criteria.
